# OLLAMA Colab Integration V3 with Ollama Companion

## Overview
Looking to run large language models but facing VRAM or computational limitations? Ollama Colab Integration V3 introduces the Ollama Companion, a Gradio WebUI, making model interaction seamless and efficient. This update focuses on integrating the Ollama Companion within the notebook and employing Cloudflared for secure, independent tunneling.

### Features
- **Ollama Companion Integration**: A Gradio WebUI integrated directly within the notebook for intuitive model interaction.
- **Cloudflared Tunneling**: Secure and reliable endpoint creation independent of third-party software.
- **Up-to-Date Model Access**: Access a constantly updated list of models through a user-friendly dropdown menu.
- **ModelFile Templater**: Easy customization of model parameters like mirostat settings and temperature.
- **Detailed Model Insights**: In-depth information about each model, including licensing and parameters.
- **Public Endpoint Management**: Easy management of public endpoints for original and OpenAI models.
- **LiteLLM Proxy Integration**: Direct control and automated polling for LiteLLM proxy.
- **Additional Utilities**: Tools for CURL command creation and manual model setup.

## Troubleshooting Experience and Behavior
1. **Model Loading Issues**: If loading large models onto the GPU causes crashes, try first with a small, dummy model.
2. **CPU Fallback**: Post-crash, models may run on CPU. Load the small model and then retry the larger one.
3. **VRAM Limitation**: Avoid exceeding 13GB of VRAM to prevent overheating and crashes.
4. **RAM and Storage Capacity**: Insufficient RAM or storage can lead to preloading issues.
5. **Using Kaggle for Enhanced Performance**: Kaggle offers up to 24GB VRAM and extra RAM, providing better performance at no extra cost. For different setups, refer to the Kaggle version on my GitHub.
